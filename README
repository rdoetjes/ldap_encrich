ldap_enrich takes certain specified attributes from one object and copies them to another objects

Options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --sLdap=SOURCE       LDAP url of source
  --sBind=SOURCEBIND   source bind
  --sPass=SOURCEPASS   source password
  --sBaseDN=SBASEDN    source password
  --sAttribs=SATTRIBS  comma seperated attributes to copy
  --sFilter=SFILTER    source filter which objects to select
  --dLdap=DEST         LDAP url of destination
  --dBind=DESTBIND     dest bind
  --dPass=DESTPASS     dest password
  --dBaseDN=DBASEDN    source password
  --dFilter=DFILTER    destination filter which objects to get receive the
                       attributes
  --dAttribs=DATTRIBS  comma seperated attributes to be copied (matching 1 to
                       1 with sAttrib)
  -r, --replace        replace destination attributes when they differ between source and dest, default is false
  -t, --simulate       Only print output do not update

ATTRIBUTE ONE TO ONE MAPPING
The source attribute list matches one to one the destination attribute list.
This allows you to copy a source attribute value to a destination attribute with a different name.
For example:
-sAttribs='loginShell, uid'
-dAttribs='loginShell, description'

Would copy the source value in loginShell to the attribute loginShell in the destination,
And coies the uid value from the source object to the description field.
NOTE: THEREFORE THERE ARE ALWAYS THE SAME AMOUNT OF ATTRIBUTES IN THE SOURCE AND DESTINATION
